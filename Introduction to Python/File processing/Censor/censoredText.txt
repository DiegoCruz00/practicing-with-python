Now that you know some data-structuring techniques, it's time to stretch your
wings and really put those tools to work. Most modem computer applications
are ******ed using a data-centered view of computing. This so-called
objectoriented ****** (OOD) process is a powerful complement to top-down ******
for *** development of reliable, cost-effective software systems. In this chapter,
we will look at *** basic principles of OOD and apply ***m in a couple of case
studies.
*** essence of ****** is describing a system in terms of magical black boxes
and ***ir interfaces. Each component provides a set of *******s through its
interface. O***r components are users or clients of *** *******s.
A client only needs to understand *** interface of a *******; *** details of
how that ******* is implemented are not important. In fact, *** internal details
may change radically and not affect *** client at all. Similarly, *** component
providing *** ******* does not have to consider how *** ******* might be used.
*** black box just has to make sure that *** ******* is faithfully delivered. This
separation of concerns is what makes *** ****** of complex systems possible.
In top-down ******, functions serve *** role of our magical black boxes. A
client program can use a function as long as it understands what *** function
does. *** details of how *** task is accomplished are encapsulated in *** function
definition.
